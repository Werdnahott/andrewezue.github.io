## Introduction
In today's digital world, weak passwords are the #1 entry point for breaches. Enter password managers: tools that generate, store, and autofill strong, unique credentials across sites.

## Top Picks
- **Bitwarden**: Open-source, free tier rocks—syncs everywhere with zero-knowledge encryption.
- **1Password**: Slick UI, family sharing—$3/month, but worth it for security audits.
- **LastPass**: Easy for beginners, but enable 2FA after recent breaches!

## My Setup
I use Bitwarden for its CLI integration—ideal for devs. Pro tip: Generate 20+ character passphrases and rotate yearly.

Coming soon: Self-hosting your own vault. What manager do you use? Share below!
